0
1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,000
All right. So it's looking pretty good and we are ready.
1

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:12,360
We've got our title section styles, our features page, our testimonial part styled, and now it's just a
2

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:19,830
matter of styling the pricing section down here. And this is a commonly used component on many web sites
3

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,870
that you go to
4

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:26,810
you’ll see a pricing table. So you don't always have to reinvent the wheel.
5

6
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,640
And in fact if you remember from earlier on, if we have a look at the Bootstrap examples, you'll see that
6

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,100
one of the examples is just a pricing page that was built using Bootstrap.
7

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:45,210
So we can actually just copy this component and put it into our web site and style it up, and then customize
8

9
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,150
the style to our liking.
9

10
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,510
So let's see how we can do that.
10

11
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,750
So if you open up the Chrome Developer Tools and you click on this arrow, then we can start selecting
11

12
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,650
the parts that we want.
12

13
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,980
Now there's quite a few different divs around here.
13

14
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,640
For example there's this top Pricing header.
14

15
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,020
There's this part which is the entire body and then there's like sort of down here, which is a container
15

16
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,930
that contains the footer as well as the pricing table.
16

17
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:17,850
But if we navigate to around here, we've got this card deck that includes nothing but just the pricing
17

18
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:18,320
table.
18

19
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,120
So that's basically what we want.
19

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,490
And if you click on the dropdown menu you can see that this is what it contains.
20

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,050
So let's take a closer look at this.
21

22
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:36,810
So if you right click on this card deck and you hit Copy element, and we head over to, again, Code Ply,
22

23
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,640
and we start a new playground, we can paste it into here,
23

24
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,830
and of course change our Bootstrap version and now hit run.
24

25
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:53,960
And you can see that we've got a ready made pricing table that we can just paste into our project.
25

26
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,820
Now of course you can change the code as you wish.
26

27
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:04,880
So, for example, this button down here, it's a btn-lg outline-primary, so that’s the blue color.
27

28
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:11,700
So what if we wanted it to be outline-dark, for example? Then we end up with outline-dark, a black button.
28

29
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,500
And you can go through this and modify the parts that you want,
29

30
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:24,760
and of course change the relevant bits of text to what your company is going to advertise.
30

31
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:32,510
But essentially this is a really really quick and easy way of importing and using components.
31

32
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:38,560
It's not just Bootstrap examples that you can look at the code from. There’s a web site called Bootsnipp
32

33
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:44,760
which I recommend you to take a look at, where they've got snippets of code for all sorts of
33

34
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,520
different components that you can look at and refer to and see how they were created.
34

35
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:57,270
So, for example, if you wanted to look for a, maybe like a log in screen, then you can see that there's
35

36
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,450
many many different things that people have styled up and created the components.
36

37
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:07,960
And you can look at the HTML and the CSS that was needed to create this.
37

38
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,830
And you can of course incorporate into your own project depending on the licensing for each of these
38

39
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,740
components.
39

40
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,650
But, you know, in our case we're learning about Bootstrap,
40

41
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:24,100
so, as always, we want to understand what we're doing before we start just blindly copy and pasting code.
41

42
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,840
So let's try and understand how this pricing table was constructed and create our own using the same
42

43
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,120
underlying Bootstrap components.
43

44
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:40,600
So in the example code that you see here the word that comes up the most often is this word card.
44

45
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:47,430
And this is because what they're using here in order to create this pricing table is a Bootstrap component
45

46
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:54,230
called Bootstrap cards, and this provides a container that looks something like this.
46

47
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,440
So you can have an image at the top, a title, some text and a button.
47

48
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,170
And because in most cases a lot of web sites need something like this,
48

49
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:07,920
they’ve made it easy for you to incorporate this using Bootstrap.
49

50
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,030
So, because they’re a little bit like your HTML, they have a header,
50

51
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:18,150
they have a body, and they can also have a footer if you so wish.
51

52
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:23,530
So let's head over to our Code Pen and just hit command A,
52

53
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,120
and we're going to delete all of our existing HTML code.
53

54
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:35,880
Now let's create a card from scratch with a header, a body and a footer, and we can do that by following the
54

55
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,150
documentation code over here.
55

56
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:43,390
So the first thing that we’ll need is a div with the class that's card.
56

57
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,480
So this is going to be a card.
57

58
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:52,090
And inside here we're going to have a card header, a card body, and a card footer.
58

59
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:59,380
So that's going to be three divs and the first one is going to have the class of card-header.
59

60
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:07,010
And then I'm just going to copy and paste this and I'm going to create the other two, which is going
60

61
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,930
to be card-body and card-footer.
61

62
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,500
And then if I hit run, it's actually quite hard to see what's going on here,
62

63
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,230
so I'll add some text.
63

64
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:27,780
So, for example, this is the Card Header, Card Body, and Card Footer.
64

65
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,320
All right.
65

66
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,250
Let's hit run and you can see that this is what our card currently looks like.
66

67
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:39,120
It's taking up the full width of the screen, which is why it’s going from edge to edge styling the different
67

68
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,580
sections slightly differently.
68

69
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:47,010
So the header has this little shadow appear, and it's highlighted in a sort of light grey color, and the
69

70
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,220
body is white.
70

71
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:53,670
So I'm going to go ahead and delete this last div which is the card footer, which we don't really need,
71

72
00:05:53,730 --> 00:06:00,220
and I'm just going to copy the rest of the code so that we can again transplant it into our web site.
72

73
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:07,980
So, in the pricing section, just below the title section and the subtitle, I'm going to paste our card
73

74
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:14,010
in here and I'm going to delete where it says Card Header and Card Body.
74

75
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:19,650
Now we're going to need three of these because we have three pricing plans at the moment, and each
75

76
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:27,410
of them are going to be a single Bootstrap card, just as they did over here in their pricing example.
76

77
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:35,130
So let's go ahead and copy and paste this twice more, so that we have three cards, and I'm going to move
77

78
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,070
some of this content over.
78

79
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,970
So for example Chihuahua is going to be in the card header.
79

80
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:49,420
That's the name of the pricing plan. And the rest of this content is going to be inside the card body.
80

81
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,450
And we're going to do the same for the other two
81

82
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:58,960
pricing tiers.
82

83
00:06:59,090 --> 00:06:59,390
All right.
83

84
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,070
So let's just go ahead and beautify, and we're done.
84

85
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,690
All right, so let's hit save and see what this looks like as it is.
85

86
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,490
And you can see that, similar to what we saw on Code Ply,
86

87
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,440
they’re actually taking up the full width of the page at the moment.
87

88
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,410
Now, we need to change that to make them stack side by side, like so.
88

89
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:27,820
Now, in the case of this Bootstrap example, what they've done is, they used this class called a card deck.
89

90
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,460
So let me show you what that does.
90

91
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:35,790
So all we need is a div that is going to go around all three of our cards and it's going to have the
91

92
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,720
class of card-deck.
92

93
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:44,460
And then I'm going to move this closing div all the way down to here, so that all three of our cards
93

94
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,340
go inside the card-deck div.
94

95
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:52,410
So now if we hit save and we head over to our web site and refresh,
95

96
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:57,270
then you can see that automatically, by wrapping all of our cards inside a card deck,
96

97
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:04,920
they get distributed evenly across the width of the web site and they also end up with the same height.
97

98
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,910
Now there’s just one problem with card decks.
98

99
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,430
They're not quite as adaptable as the Bootstrap grid system.
99

100
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,830
Now, if we take a look at the Bootstrap docs for cards, you can see that they've already got you sorted.
100

101
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:24,210
So under Using grid markup, you can see that you can actually place these cards inside our beloved Bootstrap
101

102
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:31,100
grid system in order to size them accordingly to how responsive you want your web site to be.
102

103
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,730
So we should really know how to do this.
103

104
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:36,670
But here's something new to challenge us.
104

105
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:45,190
How can you make the third card become 100 percent at the iPad width, so basically medium and below,
105

106
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:51,750
but keep the other two only 50 percent, but only when you get onto the full mobile sized do you make
106

107
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,290
all three 100 percent the width of the screen?
107

108
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,750
So at this point you’ve already seen and know quite a lot about Bootstrap grids,
108

109
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,430
so I'm going to leave this to you as a challenge.
109

110
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,780
So pause the video now and see if you can complete this challenge.
110

111
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,160
All right.
111

112
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,400
So this is a little bit different.
112

113
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,930
So it might have been quite challenging but let's see if you got it right.
113

114
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,900
So let's go through the solution now.
114

115
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:22,650
The first thing that you need for any sort of grid system to work is, you need a div class of row, so
115

116
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:28,890
I'm going to replace card-deck with row in this case, because it's a little bit easier to work with
116

117
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:37,240
in our case. Now the next thing that we need to do is to wrap each of our cards inside a Bootstrap grid.
117

118
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:45,480
So I'm going to create another div and I'm going to give this a class of col-LG-4, because by
118

119
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,410
default,
119

120
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:53,700
when we're on the largest sizes, so laptop and desktop sizes, I want each card to take up four units, so
120

121
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,760
that's a third of the page.
121

122
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:01,450
And that behavior I really want to have for all three cards.
122

123
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,650
So I'm going to do the same for the other two as well.
123

124
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:10,620
col-lg-4 for the second card, and also
124

125
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:21,690
and also for our last card. Let’s just beautify that.
125

126
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,690
All right. Cool.
126

127
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:28,890
So now that means that on a laptop and desktop it should take up a third of the width.
127

128
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:36,290
Now let's drill in a little bit deeper and specify what we want on iPad which is the medium size.
128

129
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,410
So on the medium size we want the top two to take up half of the width.
129

130
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:48,980
So that's going to be col-md-6, and I'm going to apply that to this one as well.
130

131
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,890
So these two are going to be 50 percent on iPad.
131

132
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:58,700
But the last one is either going to be col-md-12 to say that on the medium sizes it should
132

133
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:05,030
take up a full 12 units or the full width or, if you remember, if you don't specify any columns it just
133

134
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,610
defaults to 100 percent.
134

135
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:12,170
So that means any size that's below large is just going to be 100 percent.
135

136
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:16,170
And in this case any size below medium is going to be a 100 percent.
136

137
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:24,650
So now if you hit save and refresh and we start going down to our iPad size, you can see that we've
137

138
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,970
got one, two and three.
138

139
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,390
And then finally to our mobile size, one, two, three.
139

140
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,180
So that's looking pretty neat.
140

141
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:41,870
Now the next challenge I have for you is, I want you to make these buttons match the Bootstrap example
141

142
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,600
styles.
142

143
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:49,020
So have it the same as these buttons, so, namely, they're going to take up the full width of the card.
143

144
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,680
The first one’s going to be an outline button, the second two are going to be solid buttons,
144

145
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,030
and it's all going to have the dark theme.
145

146
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:59,560
So pause the video and see if you can complete this challenge.
146

147
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:05,210
All right. So this one should be easy, because we've done this quite a few times.
147

148
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,720
So let's head into our HTML and start adding some more Bootstrap classes.
148

149
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,470
So our button currently doesn't have any classes.
149

150
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,140
So we need to add some.
150

151
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:19,290
And we're going to add btn so that it styles it as a Bootstrap button.
151

152
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:25,160
And then we're going to have btn-lg to specify that we want the larger button, and then we're going
152

153
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,370
to say btn-block so that the button takes up the full width of the card.
153

154
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:37,520
And finally the first one is going to be a btn-outline-dark button, and the other two buttons are
154

155
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,730
going to have pretty much the same classes,
155

156
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,950
apart from the fact that they're not going to be outline buttons, and they're going to be just
156

157
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,170
btn-dark as in the solid buttons.
157

158
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:54,960
So let's hit save and let's refresh and, voila, our beautiful buttons have appeared.
158

159
00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:01,780
So now all we need to do is just to change the CSS a little bit to customize the layout and the text.
159

160
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:06,950
So the first thing I want to do is I want to add a little bit of padding from all sides. So let's head
160

161
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:07,990
into 
161

162
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:08,650
styles.css,
162

163
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,180
and the part that I'm going to put the padding on is this pricing section.
163

164
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:18,820
So I'm going to scroll down here and I'm going to add the pricing section
164

165
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:29,010
and here I'm going to target the pricing selector. Let’s just check the spelling, pricing, pricing, looks
165

166
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:29,810
good.
166

167
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:36,270
And then I'm going to add that padding which is going to be roughly around 100 pixels, all four sides,
167

168
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:41,490
and that gives it a little bit more space and it looks a lot nicer.
168

169
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,360
Now it's rare that you want this kind of static amount of padding on all sizes,
169

170
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:52,230
but I find that with the pricing plan, even on mobile, you need a little bit of space on all four sides,
170

171
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,990
so I think it works quite well.
171

172
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,840
Now of course if you feel different to how I feel then feel free to change it to however you want it
172

173
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,020
to,
173

174
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,190
but I quite like the way that this is spaced out.
174

175
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:04,550
All right.
175

176
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:11,100
So the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to add a little bit of padding around each of these columns
176

177
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:17,880
that holds a card, so that we push it down away from this title section, and also give them a bit more
177

178
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,670
space from each other.
178

179
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:25,180
So let's go ahead into index.html and give each of these columns a class name.
179

180
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,470
So I'm just going to call this pricing-column,
180

181
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:35,610
and I'm going to paste this class across all three cards.
181

182
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:36,010
All right.
182

183
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:43,850
So now let's hit save and we can go ahead and select that pricing-column, and then we're going to add
183

184
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,630
some padding in here.
184

185
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:52,340
So the amount I'm going to add is roughly around, I think, 3 percent from the top and bottom, and then
185

186
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,650
just 2 percent from the left and right,
186

187
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,370
so from each of the cards.
187

188
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,990
So now if we refresh,
188

189
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:03,570
you can see that there's a healthy bit of space that moves the pricing table away from this title,
189

190
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:07,540
and also we have a little bit more space between each of the cards.
190

191
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:13,250
Now, the last thing I want to do is just to make all the content inside the cards center aligned, because
191

192
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,670
our buttons are center aligned,
192

193
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:19,360
and it looks kind of weird when it's all left aligned and it's not lined up with the button.
193

194
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:26,630
So, in order to do that, I can go into the pricing section and change the text-align property to center,
194

195
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,810
hit save and refresh,
195

196
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:35,120
and this is our beautiful pricing section. And you can see that took really very little effort at all.
196

197
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:40,300
And you should now understand how each of these cards work, and all the components that we put inside,
197

198
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,990
for example the button or the card header.
198

199
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:50,600
So this is a very very simple pricing page that we've created ourselves without having to rely on the
199

200
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,540
example code.
200

201
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,060
And you can see that we're pretty close to what theirs looks like.
201

202
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,820
And that didn't really take very long at all.
202

203
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:04,250
Now, in the next lesson we're going to talk about some more advanced CSS rather than Bootstrap, and it's
203

204
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:11,480
so that we can try and get our image to go behind this feature section so that it can cut it off at
204

205
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:16,350
around this point because at the moment this is a little bit too big,
205

206
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,180
and I want the section to end right about here,
206

207
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,990
so we have to move this image behind this feature section.
207

208
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,520
So we're going to talk about the z-index and the CSS stacking order.
208

209
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,870
All of that is yet to come.
209

210
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,250
And I'll see you on the next lesson.
